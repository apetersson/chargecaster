# Agent Playbook

## Frontend Screenshot Workflow
- Use `peekaboo__list` to confirm Chrome window title and ID when needed.
- Capture the current viewport with `peekaboo__image`, targeting the Chrome window; request JPEG output and save it under `/tmp/` (for example `/tmp/chrome-localhost-5173.jpg`).
- Reference the saved JPEG path in the reply so the user can open it locally if desired.
- Immediately describe the UI shown in the screenshot so the user receives quick visual feedback without opening the file.
- After the user restarts the frontend or backend, take a fresh capture and highlight any visual deltas in the explanation.

## Tooling Notes
- `peekaboo__list` reliably enumerates Chrome windows; the stem sometimes omits off-screen windows, so fall back to manual selection if no title match.
- `peekaboo__image` works well for JPEG captures; keep `capture_focus` at `foreground` to avoid blank screenshots. Saving under `/tmp` is safe and requires no extra cleanup. (avoid using peekaboo.analyze)
- Local `curl` calls to sandboxed ports fail without escalated permissions; rerun with `with_escalated_permissions: true` and supply a short justification.
- IntelliJ MCP file tools are fast for reads but flaky for new writes; editing via `shell` (heredoc + `cat`/`apply_patch`) has proven more reliable for file creation and updates.
- `yarn` and other package scripts may emit cache warnings in the sandbox; they are harmless, but expect missing global folders on macOS runners.
- Backend config now loads once on startup; if `config.local.yaml` is missing or invalid the process aborts, so confirm the file before booting instead of trying to hot-reload it.

## General Debugging Habits
- When chart markers or gauges should mirror a live summary metric, source the marker from the latest summary payload first and treat historical samples as a fallback so the visual stays anchored to the freshest reading.
- While normalising price or unit data from external inputs, inspect the magnitude before applying conversionsâ€”values already provided in cents or base units often ship without an explicit unit field, and blindly multiplying them can inflate downstream cost calculations.
